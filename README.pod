=head1 NAME

CPAN Dependencies Graph

=head1 SETUP

To run this in a local environment, you need to create a
F<cpan_deps_graph.conf>, probably with this in:

  {
    redis_url => 'redis://localhost/',
  }

Then load the cache with at least one module's data:

  $ perl cpan_deps_graph.pl cache --deeply GraphViz2

Then run it in dev mode:

  $ perl -Ilib -S morbo cpan_deps_graph.pl
